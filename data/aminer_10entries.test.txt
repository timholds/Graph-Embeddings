AIN is a premalignant condition that can progress to invasive carcinoma through different grades of severity of the disease called AIN I, AIN II and AIN III. This paper looks at the current definition, diagnostic methods and management of AIN. The incidence of AIN has increased significantly in the last decades. The groups at risk are mainly patients with infection with human immunodeficiency virus, immunossuppressed patients and patients affected by HPV related diseases (e.g., cervical cancer or anal condyloma). Accurate diagnosis of AIN lesions consists of accurate grading and disease extension. Low grade AIN (AIN I) or in extensive lesions, follow-up is advised to determine the possible evolution to anal squamous cell carcinoma. In cases of more severe and localized lesions (AIN II and AIN III), surgical resection should be considered if the predictive postoperative morbidity is low. Screening programs for AIN are not currently in place and there might be much effort to study the management of HPV in these patients", "references": ["55a459ba612ca64868932259", "53e9a9a1b7602d97032fbf4c", "53e9ab5ab7602d97034f294a", "55a3dd10612ca648687b5656", "55a456b6612ca6486892a71c", "53e9a074b7602d970295ec46", "53e99953b7602d97021945cf", "53e9a2c8b7602d9702bd28fa", "53e9b904b7602d97044eb5fe", "56d92e16dabfae2eeee930cc", "53e9ac4eb7602d970362133a", "53e9b873b7602d97044403d0", "53e9a757b7602d9703090128", "53e9b5e6b7602d9704136811", "53e9a987b7602d97032e16f8", "53e9a2e5b7602d9702bf0dad", "53e9ba7cb7602d970469dde9", "53e9ab5ab7602d97034f42ad", "55a412d7612ca64868841256", "55a3d42a612ca648687a192d", "53e9bbb5b7602d9704800040", "55a3ecfa612ca648687df43f", "53e99cedb7602d97025a0f5b", "53e9b79fb7602d9704343f04", "53e9b0c2b7602d9703b38d02", "53e99cfdb7602d97025b1953", "53e99ff0b7602d97028d17e4", "53e9bc27b7602d9704892ce8", "55a508d2612c6b12ab01a8a0", "55a431c3612ca648688b0e82", "55a4a456612ca648689ead50", "53e9a15bb7602d9702a4fc3c", "53e9b550b7602d970408ac04", "53e9a84eb7602d9703199d81", "53e9ad33b7602d9703716e83", "55a4c4b7612c6b12aaf99a66", "53e9b55db7602d9704097c32", "53e9a0eeb7602d97029d9600", "53e9a569b7602d9702e8cc8e", "53e999b4b7602d97021f8a13", "53e997e9b7602d9701fe67c7", "53e9a9dfb7602d9703342ae0", "53e9be14b7602d9704aca74e", "53e9b206b7602d9703c9bbf9", "55a3eb9b612ca648687dae87", "53e9aa5cb7602d97033ce411", "55a3d390612ca6486879f7fd", "55a4c4b6612c6b12aaf998e4", "53e9bbc8b7602d9704816746"]}

This paper/study instead, maintains that the approach of patching the current architecture - firewalls, proxies, and other middle boxes are helpful and do not increase the complexity, thus do not endanger the evolvability and simplicity of the network. We believe that by better and more global laws the security issues will be minimized - this is what even the most advanced ideas for new architectures call for, since there are no guarantees for absolute security. The integration with cell phone networks and services can solve majority of existing issues with mobility, and energy efficiency. Also models for naming, multicast and anycast are also proposed, and as the need for mobility is growing, together with the need for better identification of data and services instead of machines, these models will emerge slowly. This industry is in the beginning of its era, and there are some great solutions on issues related to mobile support to smartphone devices, and we believe this field is moving in the right direction, thus rejecting the need for major changes in the current architecture.", "references": ["53e9a23fb7602d9702b497e4", "53e997fcb7602d9702004259", "53e9a480b7602d9702d9b839", "53e9b350b7602d9703e2a46a", "53e9b4bfb7602d9703fd5877", "53e9b023b7602d9703a7c241", "53e9a099b7602d97029833d0", "53e9b82fb7602d97043ebe20", "53e99d80b7602d970263bdf8", "53e9a1c9b7602d9702abf701", "53e99e38b7602d97026f8eff", "53e9a8beb7602d970321187c", "53e99a20b7602d97022784c9", "53e99a04b7602d97022504e5", "53e9b58eb7602d97040d22ec", "53e9a237b7602d9702b3c0f2", "53e9b27bb7602d9703d1ee78", "53e9ac7ab7602d970364daa5"]}
