= The Degree Centrality algorithm

// tag::introduction[]
Degree Centrality is the simplest of all the centrality algorithms.
It measures the number of incoming and outgoing relationships from a node.

The algorithm can help us find popular nodes in a graph.
// end::introduction[]

== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
Degree Centrality was proposed by Linton C. Freeman in his 1979 paper http://leonidzhukov.net/hse/2014/socialnetworks/papers/freeman79-centrality.pdf[Centrality in Social Networks Conceptual Clarification^].
While the algorithm can be used to find the popularity of individual nodes, it is often used as part of a global analysis where we calculate the minimum degree, maximum degree, mean degree, and standard deviation across the whole graph.

== Use-cases - when to use the Degree Centrality algorithm


// tag::use-case[]

* Degree centrality is an important component of any attempt to determine the most important people on a social network.
For example, in BrandWatch's https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-influential-men-and-women-2017/[most influential men and women on Twitter 2017^] the top 5 people in each category have over 40m followers each.

* Weighted degree centrality has been used to help separate fraudsters from legitimate users of an online auction.
The weighted centrality for fraudsters is significantly higher because they tend to collude with each other to artificially increase the price of items.

We can see that Doug is the most popular user in our imaginary Twitter graph with 5 followers - all other users follow him but he doesn't follow anybody back.
In the real Twitter network celebrities have very high follower counts but tend to follow very few back people.
We could therefore consider Doug a celebrity!
