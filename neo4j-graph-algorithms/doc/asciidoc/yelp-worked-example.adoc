It's always good fun reading hotel reviews so we're going to focus on businesses in that sector.
We can find out how many businesses there are by running the following query:

One way we can do this is by ordering reviews based on the influence of the reviewer on Yelp.

We'll start by finding users who have reviewed more than 5 hotels.
After that we'll find the social network between those users and work out which users sit at the centre of that network.
This should reveal the most influential people.
The FRIENDS relationship is an example of a bidirectional relationship
i.e. if Person A is friends with Person B then Person B is also friends with Person A.
Neo4j stores a directed graph but we can choose to ignore the direction when we query the graph.

We want to execute the page rank algorithm over a projected graph of users that have reviewed hotels and then add a `hotelPageRank` property to each of those users.
This is the first example where we can express the projected graph in terms of node labels and relationship types.
Instead we will write Cypher statements to project the required graph.

See the Usage section of The Neo4j Graph Algorithms Library chapter for a refresher on the different usage options.

The following query will execute the page rank algorithm:
