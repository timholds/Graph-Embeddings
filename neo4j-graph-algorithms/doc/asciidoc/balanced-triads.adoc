== Balanced Triads algorithm sample

.The following will create a sample graph:

.The following will return a stream of triples, with `nodeId` for each triangle:

| Will    | Michael | Chris
| Will    | Mark    | Michael

// end::stream-triples-result[]

// tag::stream-triples-explanation[]
We can see that there are `KNOWS` triangles containing "Will, Michael, and Chris", "Will, Mark, and Michael", and "Michael, Karin, and Chris".
This means that everybody in the triangle knows each other.

.The following will count the number of triangles that a node is member of, and write it back. It will return the total triangle count and average clustering coefficient of the given graph:

We learn that Michael is part of the most triangles, but it's Karin and Mark who are the best at introducing their friends - all of the people who know them, know each other!

[[algorithms-balanced-triads-example]]
== Example usage

In graph theory, a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient[clustering coefficient] is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.
Evidence suggests that in most real-world networks, and in particular social networks, nodes tend to create tightly knit groups characterised by a relatively high density of ties; this likelihood tends to be greater than the average probability of a tie randomly established between two nodes.

We check if this holds true for Yelp's social network of friends:

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/triangle-count.cypher[tag=triangle-write-yelp]
----

Average clustering coefficient is 0.0523, which is really low for a social network.
This indicates that groups of friends are not tightly knit together, but rather sparse.
We can assume that users are not on Yelp for finding and creating friends, like Facebook for example, but rather something else, like finding good restaurant recommendations.

Local triangle count and clustering coefficient of nodes can be used as features in finding influencers in social networks.

== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
This can also be used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.

.Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config:

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/triangle-count.cypher[tag=cypher-loading]
----


== Graph type support

The Triangle Count algorithms support the following graph type:

* [x] undirected, unweighted


ifndef::env-docs[]
== References

// tag::references[]
* a
* b
* c
// end::references[]
endif::env-docs[]
