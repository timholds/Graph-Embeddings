// tag::introduction[]
Yen's K-shortest paths algorithm computes single-source K-shortest loopless paths for a graph with non-negative relationship weights.

== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
Algorithm was defined in 1971 by Jin Y. Yen in the research paper https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.17.11.712[Finding the K Shortest Loopless Paths in a Network].
Our implementation uses Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path and then proceeds to find k-1 deviations of the shortest paths.

== Constraints - when not to use the Yen's K-shortest paths algorithm

// tag::constraint[]
Yen's K-Shortest paths algorithm does not support negative weights.
The algorithm assumes that adding a relationship to a path can never make a path shorter - an invariant that would be violated with negative weights.

== Graph type support

The Shortest Path algorithms support the following graph types:

* [x] directed, unweighted:
** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: null
* [x] directed, weighted
** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: 'cost'
* [x] undirected, unweighted
** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: null
* [x] undirected, weighted
** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: 'cost'


== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
This can also be used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.

.Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config:

== Implementations

`algo.kShortestPaths`

* Specify start and end node, find the k-shortest path between them.
* If initialized with an non-existing weight-property, it will treat the graph as unweighted.

:leveloffset: +1

Yen's algorithm computes single-source K-shortest loopless paths for a graph with non-negative relationship cost.
The algorithm was published by Jin Y. Yen in 1971 and employs any shortest path algorithm to find the best path, then proceeds to find K âˆ’ 1 deviations of the best path.
