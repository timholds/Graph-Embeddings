// tag::introduction[]
The Label Propagation algorithm (LPA) is a fast algorithm for finding communities in a graph.
It detects these communities using network structure alone as its guide, and doesn't require a pre-defined objective function or prior information about the communities.

One interesting feature of LPA is that nodes can be assigned preliminary labels to narrow down the range of solutions generated.
This means that it can be used as semi-supervised way of finding communities where we hand-pick some initial communities.

== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
LPA is a relatively new algorithm, and was only proposed by Raghavan et al in 2007, in https://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.2938.pdf["Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks"^].
It works by propagating labels throughout the network and forming communities based on this process of label propagation.

The intuition behind the algorithm is that a single label can quickly become dominant in a densely connected group of nodes, but will have trouble crossing a sparsely connected region.
Labels will get trapped inside a densely connected group of nodes, and those nodes that end up with the same label when the algorithms finish can be considered part of the same community.
// end::explanation[]

// tag::formula[]
The algorithm works as follows:

* Every node is initialized with a unique label (an identifier).
* These labels propagate through the network.
* At every iteration of propagation, each node updates its label to the one that the maximum numbers of its neighbours belongs to.
  Ties are broken uniformly and randomly.
* LPA reaches convergence when each node has the majority label of its neighbours.

As labels propagate, densely connected groups of nodes quickly reach a consensus on a unique label.
At the end of the propagation only a few labels will remain - most will have disappeared.
Nodes that have the same label at convergence are said to belong to the same community.

== Use-cases - when to use the Label Propagation algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
* Label propagation has been used to assign polarity of tweets, as a part of semantic analysis which uses seed labels from a classifier trained to detect positive and negative emoticons in combination with Twitter follower graph.
  For more information, see https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2140465[Twitter polarity classification with label propagation over lexical links and the follower graph]
* Label propagation has been used to estimate potentially dangerous combinations of drugs to co-prescribe to a patient, based on the chemical similarity and side effect profiles.
  The study can be found in  https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12339[Label Propagation Prediction of Drug-Drug Interactions Based on Clinical Side Effects]
* Label propagation has been used to infer features of utterances in a dialogue, for a machine learning model to track user intention with the help of Wikidata knowledge graph of concepts and their relations.

[[algorithms-label-propagation-limitations]]
== Constraints - when not to use the Label Propagation algorithm

// tag::constraint[]
In contrast with other algorithms, label propagation can result in different community structures when run multiple times on the same graph.
The range of solutions can be narrowed if some nodes are given preliminary labels, while others are unlabelled.
Unlabelled nodes will be more likely to adapt the preliminary labels.

Our algorithm found two communities, with 3 members each.

It appears that Michael, Bridget, and Alice belong together, as do Doug and Mark.
Only Charles doesn't strongly fit into either side, but ends up with Doug and Mark.

=== Using seed labels

At the beginning of the algorithm, every node is initialized with unique label (called as identifier) and the labels propagate through the network.

It is possible to define preliminary labels (identifiers) of nodes using the `partition` parameter.
We need to save a preliminary set of labels that we would like to run the Label Propagation algorithm with as a property of nodes (must be a number).
In our example graph we saved them as the property `seed_label`.

The algorithm first checks if there is a seed label assigned to the node, and loads it if there is one.
If there isn't one, it assigns the node new unique label (node ID is used).
Using this preliminary set of labels (identifiers), it then sequentially updates each node's label to a new one, which is the most frequent label among its neighbors at every label propagation step (iteration).

.The following will run the algorithm with pre-defined labels:

== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
This can also be used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.

.Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config:

[source, cypher]

include::scripts/label-propagation.cypher[tag=cypher-loading]

== Graph type support

The Label Propagation algorithm supports the following graph types:

* [x] directed, unweighted:
** direction: 'INCOMING' or 'OUTGOING', weightProperty: null
* [x] directed, weighted
** direction: 'INCOMING' or 'OUTGOING', weightProperty : 'weight'
* [x] undirected, unweighted
** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: null
* [x] undirected, weighted
** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: 'weight'
