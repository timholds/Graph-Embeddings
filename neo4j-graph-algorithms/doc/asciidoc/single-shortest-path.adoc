This section describes the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.

// tag::introduction[]
The Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithm calculates the shortest (weighted) path from a node to all other nodes in the graph.
// end::introduction[]


[[algorithms-single-source-shortest-path-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
SSSP came into prominence at the same time as the shortest path algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm can act as an implementation for both problems.

We implement a delta-stepping algorithm that has been https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02113v1.pdf[shown to outperform Dijkstra's^].

== Use-cases - when to use the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First[Open Shortest Path First^] is a routing protocol for IP networks.
  It uses Dijkstra's algorithm to help detect changes in topology, such as link failures, and https://routing-bits.com/2009/08/06/ospf-convergence/[come up with a new routing structure in seconds^].
// end::use-case[]


[[algorithms-single-source-shortest-path-limitations]]
== Constraints - when not to use the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm

// tag::constraint[]
Delta stepping does not support negative weights.
The algorithm assumes that adding a relationship to a path can never make a path shorter - an invariant that would be violated with negative weights.
// end::constraint[]

== Graph type support

The shortest path algorithms support the following graph types:

* [x] directed, unweighted:
** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: null
* [x] directed, weighted
** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: 'cost'
* [x] undirected, unweighted
** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: null
* [x] undirected, weighted
** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: 'cost'


== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
This can also be used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.

.Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config:

== Implementations

`algo.shortestPath.deltaStepping`

* Specify start node, find the shortest paths to all other nodes.
* Parallel non-negative single source shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs.
* It can be tweaked using the delta-parameter which controls the grade of concurrency.
* If initialized with an non-existing weight-property, it will treat the graph as unweighted.

== Implementation details

:leveloffset: +1
// copied from: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/issues/80

A Single Source Shortest Path algorithm calculates a path between a pair of nodes whose summed weights are minimal.
A common algorithm used is Dijkstra.
On the other hand, All Pairs Shortest Path calculates a shortest path forest containing all paths between the nodes in the graph.
An algorithm to solve this is Floyd Warshall or Parallel Johnson's algorithm.

## Progress

- [x] single threaded implementation
- [x] tests
- [x] simple benchmark
- [x] implement procedure
- [ ] benchmark on bigger graphs
- [ ] parallelization
- [ ] evaluation

## Requirements

`(Outgoing)RelationshipIterator` & `Weights`

## Data structured involved

- An int-based Fibonacci Heap which implements an efficient priority queue.
- Different Container for Costs / visited state / paths

## ToDo

### benchmark

Implement benchmark on big graph

### parallelization

Parallizing _All Pairs Shortest Path_ might be easy using Dijkstra on each thread for a different node. An easy approach for _Single Source SP_ may use two threads. One starting at the start-node, one at the end-node. The first wins. [More](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vs3/comp422/lecture-notes/comp422-lec24-s08-v2.pdf)

### evaluation

- Performance tests on different dataset sizes / level of concurrency


== Details


=== algo.shortestPath.deltaStepping

TODO naming!?
- parallel non-negative single source shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs
- It can be tweaked using the delta-parameter which controls the grade of concurrency.
- returns minimum distance to *all other nodes*
- if initialized with an non-existing weight-property and a defaultWeight of 1.0 its result can be interpreted as
 the number of nodes to reach the target
