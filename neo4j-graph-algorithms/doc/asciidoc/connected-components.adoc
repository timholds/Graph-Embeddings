This section describes the Connected Components algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.

// tag::introduction[]
The Connected Components, or `Union Find`, algorithm finds sets of connected nodes in an undirected graph where each node is reachable from any other node in the same set.
It differs from the Strongly Connected Components algorithm (SCC) because it only needs a path to exist between pairs of nodes in one direction, whereas SCC needs a path to exist in both directions.
As with SCC, `UnionFind` is often used early in an analysis to understand a graph's structure.

[[algorithms-connected-components-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
The algorithm was first described by Bernard A. Galler and Michael J. Fischer in 1964.
The components in a graph are computed using either the breadth-first search or depth-first search algorithms.

== Use-cases - when to use the Connected Components algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
* Testing whether a graph is connected is an essential pre-processing step for every graph algorithm.
  Such tests can be performed so quickly, and easily, that you should always verify that your input graph is connected, even when you know it has to be.
  Subtle, difficult-to-detect, bugs often result when your algorithm is run only on one component of a disconnected graph.
* `Union Find` can be used to keep track of clusters of database records, as part of the de-duplication process - an important task in master data management applications.
  Read more in http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.28.8405["An efficient domain-independent algorithm for detecting approximately duplicate database records"^].
* Weakly connected components (WCC) can be used to analyse citation networks.
  One study uses WCC to work out how well connected the network is, and then to see whether the connectivity remains if 'hub' or 'authority' nodes are moved from the graph.

[[algorithms-connected-components-sample]]
== Connected Components algorithm sample

If we recall that an undirected graph is connected if, for every pair of vertices there is a path in the graph between those vertices.
A connected component of an undirected graph is a maximal connected subgraph of the graph.
That means that the direction of the relationships in our graph are ignored - we treat the graph as undirected.

We have two implementations of the Connected Components algorithm.
The first treats the graph as unweighted and the second treats it as weighted, where you can define the threshold of the weight above which relationships are included.

=== Weighted version

If you define the property that holds the weight (`weightProperty`) and the threshold, it means the nodes are only connected, if the threshold on the weight of the relationship is high enough, otherwise the relationship is thrown away.

// end::weighted-stream-sample-graph-result[]

// tag::weighted-stream-sample-graph-explanation[]
In this case we can see that, because the weight of the relationship between Bridget and Alice is only 0.5, the relationship is ignored by the algorithm, and Bridget ends up in her own component.

[[algorithms-connected-components-example]]
== Example usage

As mentioned above, connected components are an essential step in preprocessing your data.
One reason is that most centralities suffer from disconnected components, or you just want to find disconnected groups of nodes.
Int his example, Yelp's social network will be used to demonstrate how to proceed when dealing with real world data.
A typical social network consists of one big component and a number of small disconnected components.

.The following will get the count of connected components:
[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/connected-components.cypher[tag=count-component-yelp]
----

We get back the count of disconnected components being 18512 if we do not count users without friends.
Let's now check the size of top 20 components to get a better picture:

.The following will get the size of top 20 components:
[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/connected-components.cypher[tag=top-20-component-yelp]
----

The biggest component has 8938630 out of total 8981389 (99,5%).
It is quite high, but not shocking, as we have a friendship social network where we can expect small world effect and 6 degree of separation rule, where you can get to any person in a social network, just depends how long is the path.

We can now move on to next step of analysis and run centralities on only the biggest components, so that our results will be more accurate.
We will write back the results to the node, and use centralities with Cypher loading, or set a new label for the biggest component.

== Huge graph projection

If our projected graph contains more than 2 billion nodes or relationships, we need to use huge graph projection, as the default label and relationship-type projection has a limitation of 2 billion nodes and 2 billion relationships.

.Set `graph:'huge'` in the config:

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/connected-components.cypher[tag=huge-projection]
----


== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
This can also be used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.

.Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config:

== Implementations

`algo.unionFind`

* If a threshold configuration parameter is supplied, only relationships with a property value higher than the threshold are merged.
+
`algo.unionFind.queue`

* Parallel `Union Find`, using `ExecutorService` only.
* Algorithm based on the idea that `DisjointSetStruct` can be built using just a partition of the nodes, which are then merged pairwise.
* The implementation is based on a queue which acts as a buffer for each computed `DisjointSetStruct`.
  As long as there are more elements on the queue, the algorithm takes two, merges them, and adds its result to the queue until only 1 element remains.

`algo.unionFind.forkJoinMerge`

* Like in `algo.unionFind.queue`, the resulting `DisjointSetStruct` of each node-partition is merged by the `ForkJoin` pool, while the calculation of the `DisjointSetStruct` is done by the `ExecutorService`.

`algo.unionFind.forkJoin`

* Calculation and merge using `forkJoinPool`

`algo.unionFind.mscoloring`

* Coloring based parallel algorithm

== Implementation details

:leveloffset: +1
// copied from: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/issues/79

_Connected Components_ or _Union Find_ basically finds sets of connected nodes where each node is reachable from any other node in the same set. One implementation also evaluates a Predicate on each relation which allows partitioning of the graph based on Relationships and Properties.

## Progress

- [x] single threaded implementation
- [x] tests
- [x] simple benchmark
- [x] implement procedure
- [x] benchmark on bigger graphs
- [x] parallelization
- [x] evaluation

## Requirements

`AllRelationshipIterator` & `Weights`

## Data structured involved

We use a disjoint-set-structure which is based on a parent-array-tree. The DSS can be used to efficiently ask if two nodes are reachable by each other. [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)

## ToDo

### benchmark

Implement benchmark on big graph &

- stream nodeId-setId pairs
- calculate setSize-setCount


### parallelization

One approach to parallelize _Union Find_ might be _relationship partitioning_ where each thread performs the execution into it's own DSS instance on a subset of relationships. So each thread calculates a distinct set of unions. Later we can merge each DSS pairwise which can also be perfomed in parallel. Nonetheless the memory consumption might be high due to the preallocated array in DSS. We could also switch to a growing container if this is a problem.

### evaluation

- Performance tests on different dataset sizes / level of concurrency


== Details

- writes a cluster-id to each node representing the a connected component where each node
is reachable from any other node


=== algo.unionFind

- if a threshold configuration parameter is supplied only relationships with a property value higher then the threshold
are merged


=== algo.unionFind.queue

- parallel Union Find using ExecutorService only.
- Algorithm based on the idea that DisjointSetStruct can be built using just a partition of the nodes
which are then merged pairwise.
- The implementation is based on a queue which acts as a buffer for each computed DSS. As long as there are
more elements on the queue the algorithm takes two, merges them and adds its result to the queue until only
1 element remains.


=== algo.unionFind.forkJoinMerge

-  Like in *exp1* the resulting DSS of each node-partition is merged by the ForkJoin pool while
the calculation of the DSS is done by the ExecutorService.


=== algo.unionFind.forkJoin

- calculation and merge using forkJoinPool
