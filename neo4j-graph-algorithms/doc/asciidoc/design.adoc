= Neo4j Graph Algorithms

== The Goal

The goal of the project is an API optimized for the development of graph algorithms.
 Furthermore, various implementations should  be integrated on the basis of the API.

== Model

=== Design Decisions

- each algorithm has different requirements to the graph API
- so we distributed the graph api to several interfaces
- each is responsible for access to different parts of the graph data

- most algorithms need repeated access to the data while some others don't
- there are _data sources_ which buffer data locally while others do direct access to the Neo4J DB
- the implementation itself decides which strategy it uses
- the goal is to have several implementations with different properties regarding parallelizability, buffering and efficiency
- each algorithm depend on a set of these _data sources_
- the Graph interface is a composition of often used sources

- intention for the future is to add a way to annotate the capabilities of each _data source_ and requirements
of the algorithms.
- the information can then be used to dynamically generate ab object-graph to solve many algorithms at once
or use the output of one as input for another algorithm

In conclusion, every _data source_ defines a way to access different features of the graph but
 the implementation itself decides if concurrent or repeated access is supported.

=== Data Sources

Due to the different requirements of an algorithm to the graph we decided to move away from a single centralized
 data source, to a more flexible approach and divided the methods on multiple interfaces. The Graph interface is now
 a composition of different interfaces.

The new approach allows us to separate different data sets from importing and thus saves memory and loading time.
 We can also have many implementations for a _data source_ with different characteristics.

=== Definition

==== org.neo4j.graphalgo.api.IdMapping

- responsible for mapping long neo4j ids to integer ids and back
- also knows the actual count of nodes loaded
- limits us to 2b nodes but eases handling
- int-ids are arranged in consecutive order, the lowest id is always `0` and the highest is `nodeCount - 1`

==== org.neo4j.graphalgo.api.Degrees

- provides the degree (count of relationships) for a given node and direction

==== org.neo4j.graphalgo.api.NodeIterator

- provides methods for iterating over nodes
- defined as Predicate

==== org.neo4j.graphalgo.api.RelationshipIterator

- provides methods for iterating over relationships from a given node and given direction
- is itself a combination of `org.neo4j.graphalgo.api.IncomingRelationshipIterator` & `org.neo4j.graphalgo.api.OutgoingRelationshipIterator`
- defined as Predicate

==== org.neo4j.graphalgo.api.IncomingRelationshipIterator

- provides methods for iterating over _incoming_ relationships from a given node

==== org.neo4j.graphalgo.api.OutgoingRelationshipIterator

- provides methods for iterating over _outgoing_ relationships from a given node

==== [.line-through]#org.neo4j.graphalgo.api.WeightedRelationshipIterator#

- outdated but still used in some algorithms
- iterates over relationships from a given node and direction and provides a single weight as double

==== org.neo4j.graphalgo.api.RelationshipWeights

- api2 approach for accessing weights
- provides a double weight property for a given start/end-node pair

==== org.neo4j.graphalgo.api.NodeWeights

- provides a double weight property for a given node

==== org.neo4j.graphalgo.api.AllRelationshipIterator

- provides a way to iterate once over all relationships without a given start node
- defined as Predicate

=== Loading step

- some algorithms need repeated access to the data
- buffering the data locally is therefore needed for efficient access
- we tried several strategies which are implemented in Heavy-, Light- and Kernel-Graph
- all of them implement the original Graph interface
- they have different memory and performance characteristics
- Loading is done in Factories
- the GraphLoader acts as a builder, gets all desired info (label, rel-name etc.) and the factory-class
- api2 data sources on the other hand have to implement their own importing mechanism (part of future work)

=== Procedure configuration

- algorithms share some common configuration settings
- e.g. labelName/Query, batchSize, concurrency, ..
- to ease their retrieval we built a wrapper (`org.neo4j.graphalgo.core.ProcedureConfiguration`) around the config-map

=== Data Export

- export is mostly done using the `org.neo4j.graphalgo.core.write.Exporter`
- exports data in batches
