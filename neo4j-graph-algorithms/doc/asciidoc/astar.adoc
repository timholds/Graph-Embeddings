= The A* algorithm

[abstract]
--
This section describes the A* algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.

// tag::introduction[]
The A* (pronounced “A-star”) algorithm improves on the classic Dijkstra algorithm.
It is based upon the observation that some searches are informed, and that by being informed we can make better choices over which paths to take through the graph.
// end::introduction[]


[[algorithms-a_star-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
The A* algorithm was first described in 1968 by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson, and Bertram Raphael.
For more information, see https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4082128/[A Formal Basis for the Heuristic Determination of Minimum Cost Paths].

In A*, we split the path cost into two parts:

`g(n)`::
 This is the cost of the path from the starting point to some node n.

`h(n)`::
 This represents the estimated cost of the path from the node n to the destination node, as computed by a heuristic (an intelligent guess).

The A* algorithm balances `g(n)` and `h(n)` as it iterates the graph, thereby ensuring that at each iteration it chooses the node with the lowest overall cost `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`.

In our implementation, geospatial distance is used as heurestic.

[[algorithms-a_star-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the A* algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
* The A* algorithm can be used to find shortest paths between single pairs of locations, where GPS coordinates are known.

== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
This can also be used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.

.Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config:

[source, cypher]

include::scripts/astar.cypher[tag=cypher-loading]

== Graph type support

The Shortest Path algorithms support the following graph types:

* [x] directed, unweighted:
** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: null
* [x] directed, weighted
** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: 'cost'
* [x] undirected, unweighted
** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: null
* [x] undirected, weighted
** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: 'cost'
