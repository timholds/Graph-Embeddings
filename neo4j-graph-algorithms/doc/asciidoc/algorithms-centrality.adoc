// todo sensible ordering

The following centrality algorithms determine the importance of distinct nodes in a network:

* <<algorithms-pagerank, PageRank>> (`algo.pageRank`)
* <<algorithms-betweenness-centrality, Betweenness Centrality>> (`algo.betweenness`)
* <<algorithms-closeness-centrality, Closeness Centrality>> (`algo.closeness`)
* <<algorithms-harmonic-centrality, Harmonic Centrality>> (`algo.closeness.harmonic`)
