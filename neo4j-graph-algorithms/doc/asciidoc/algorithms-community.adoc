// todo introduction to graph algorithms, also say something about pregel & parallelization
// todo sensible ordering

The following community detection algorithms evaluate how a group is clustered or partitioned, as well as its tendency to strengthen or break apart:

* <<algorithms-louvain, Louvain>> (`algo.louvain`)
* <<algorithms-label-propagation, Label Propagation>> (`algo.labelPropagation`)
* <<algorithms-connected-components, Connected Components>> (`algo.unionFind`)
* <<algorithms-strongly-connected-components, Strongly Connected Components>> (`algo.scc`)
* <<algorithms-triangle-count-clustering-coefficient, Triangle Counting / Clustering Coefficient>> (`algo.triangleCount`)
