= The Cosine Similarity algorithm

[abstract]

This section describes the Cosine Similarity algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.

// tag::introduction[]
link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity[Cosine similarity] is the cosine of the angle between two _n_-dimensional vectors in an _n_-dimensional space.
It is the dot product of the two vectors divided by the product of the two vectors' lengths (or magnitudes).

[[algorithms-similarity-cosine-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Cosine similarity is computed using the following formula:

image::cosine-similarity.png[role="middle"]

Values range between -1 and 1, where -1 is perfectly dissimilar and 1 is perfectly similar.

The library contains both procedures and functions to calculate similarity between sets of data.
The function is best used when calculating the similarity between small numbers of sets.
The procedures parallelize the computation and are therefore a better bet when computing similarities on bigger datasets.

Cosine similarity is only calculated over non-NULL dimensions.
When calling the function, we should provide lists that contain the overlapping items.
The procedures expect to receive the same length lists for all items, so we need to pad those lists with 0s where necessary.

== Use-cases - when to use the Cosine Similarity algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
We can use the Cosine Similarity algorithm to work out the similarity between two things.
We might then use the computed similarity as part of a recommendation query.
For example, to get movie recommendations based on the preferences of users who have given similar ratings to other movies that you've seen.

.The following will return the cosine similarity of two lists of numbers:

// end::function[]

// tag::function-explanation[]
These two lists of numbers have a Cosine similarity of 0.863.
We can see how this result is derived by breaking down the formula:

image::cosine-similarity2.png[role="middle"]

// This is the raw information for this image:
// [subs = none]
// \( similarity(A, B) = \frac{3 \cdot 10 + 8 \cdot 8 + 7 \cdot 6 + 5 \cdot 6 + 2 \cdot 4 + 9 \cdot 5}{\sqrt{3^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 5^2 + 2^2 + 9^2} \times \sqrt{10^2 + 8^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 5^2}} = \frac{219}{15.2315 \times 16.6433} = 0.8639 \)

Arya and Karin have the most similar food tastes, with a score of 0.889.
The maximum score is 1, so they are pretty close to the maximum level of similarity.
We also have 3 pairs of users who are not similar at all.
We'd probably want to filter those out, which we can do by passing in the `similarityCutoff` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of node pairs that have a similarity of at least 0.1, along with their cosine similarities:

We can see that those users with no similarity have been filtered out.
If we're implementing a k-Nearest Neighbors type query we might instead want to find the most similar `k` users for a given user.
We can do that by passing in the `topK` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of users along with the most similar user to them (i.e. `k=1`):

These results will not be symmetrical.
For example, the person most similar to Praveena is Michael, but the person most similar to Zhen is also Michael.
