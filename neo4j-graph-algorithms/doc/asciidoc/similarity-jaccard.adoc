= The Jaccard Similarity algorithm

[abstract]

This section describes the Jaccard Similarity algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.

// tag::introduction[]
Jaccard similarity (coefficient), a term coined by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Jaccard[Paul Jaccard^], measures similarities between sets.
It is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two sets.

[[algorithms-similarity-jaccard-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Jaccard similarity is computed using the following formula:

image::jaccard.png[role="middle"]

// This is the raw information for this image:
// ```
// J(A,B) = ∣A ∩ B∣ / ∣(A ∪ B)∣
//        = ∣A ∩ B∣ / ∣A∣ + ∣B∣ - ∣A ∩ B|
// ```

The library contains both procedures and functions to calculate similarity between sets of data.
The function is best used when calculating the similarity between small numbers of sets.
The procedures parallelize the computation, and are therefore a better bet when computing similarities on bigger datasets.

== Use-cases - when to use the Jaccard Similarity algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
We can use the Jaccard Similarity algorithm to work out the similarity between two things.
We might then use the computed similarity as part of a recommendation query.
For example, you can use the Jaccard Similarity algorithm to show the products that were purchased by similar customers, in terms of previous products purchased.

.The following will return the Jaccard similarity of two lists of numbers:

| `similarity`
| 0.4
|===
// end::function[]

// tag::function-explanation[]
These two lists of numbers have a Jaccard similarity of 0.4.
We can see how this result is derived by breaking down the formula:

```
J(A,B) = ∣A ∩ B∣ / ∣A∣ + ∣B∣ - ∣A ∩ B|
J(A,B) = 2 / 3 + 4 - 2
       = 2 / 5
       = 0.4
```

Arya and Karin, and Zhen and Michael have the most similar food preferences, with two overlapping cuisines for a similarity of 0.66.
We also have 3 pairs of users who are not similar at all.
We'd probably want to filter those out, which we can do by passing in the `similarityCutoff` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of node pairs that have a similarity of at least 0.1, along with their intersection and Jaccard similarities:

| Zhen     | Michael  | 2              | 0.66
| Zhen     | Praveena | 1              | 0.33

| Praveena | Michael  | 1              | 0.25
| Praveena | Arya     | 1              | 0.25
| Michael  | Arya     | 1              | 0.2
|===
// end::stream-similarity-cutoff[]

We can see that those users with no similarity have been filtered out.
If we're implementing a k-Nearest Neighbors type query we might instead want to find the most similar `k` users for a given user.
We can do that by passing in the `topK` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of users along with the most similar user to them (i.e. `k=1`):

| Praveena | Zhen     | 0.33
| Zhen     | Michael  | 0.66
|===
// end::stream-topk[]

These results will not be symmetrical.
For example, the person most similar to Praveena is Zhen, but the person most similar to Zhen is actually Michael.

We then could write a query to find out what types of cuisine that other people similar to us might like.
