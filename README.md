# Scaling Science
## Overview
We are leveraging methods from machine learning, artificial intelligence, databases, and graph theory to improve our ability to compute on scientific knowledgeâ€”and thus more intelligently plan, collaborate, and allocate resources to science. The end goal is the creation of a decentralized, community-focused scientific knowledge dissemination platform.

## Data
For now, we are working with the publication metadata released by the [Open Academic Graph project](https://www.openacademic.ai/oag/). This is a joining of the [Microsoft Academic Graph](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/) and [AMiner database](https://aminer.org/).

In the future, we will move to active scraping and integration of [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), [The PMC Open Access Subset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/), and other data sources. Of course, the end goal will be a platform that scientists submit work and results to directly, similar to Github.

## Version control
Git. Please submit issues for new features and bugs, create branches when working on issues, and submit pull requests for merging back into master so everyone is synchronized.

## Project management
We are using [Github Projects](https://github.com/jameswweis/scaling-science/projects) to coordinate the work and issues in the different branches of this project.


## Quick start

Run `./start_docker.sh` to read/set some environmental variables and build and launch `neo4j` and `jupyter notebook` containers. Console will print a token-based authentication link to paste into your browser to connect to both the `jupyter` session and the `neo4j` broser portal. The [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) database is password protected via the credentials in the `NEO4J_AUTH` environmental variable set in `docker-compose.yml`.
