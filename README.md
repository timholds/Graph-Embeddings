# Scaling Science
## Overview
We are leveraging methods from machine learning, artificial intelligence, databases, and graph theory to improve our ability to compute on scientific knowledgeâ€”and thus more intelligently plan, collaborate, and allocate resources to science. The end goal is the creation of a decentralized, community-focused scientific knowledge dissemination platform.

## Data
For now, we are working with the publication metadata released by the [Open Academic Graph project](https://www.openacademic.ai/oag/). This is a joining of the [Microsoft Academic Graph](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/) and [AMiner database](https://aminer.org/).

In the future, we will move to active scraping and integration of [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), [The PMC Open Access Subset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/), and other data sources. Of course, the end goal will be a platform that scientists submit work and results to directly, similar to Github. 

## Dependencies and documentation

* TODO: This is all being changed in this branch, which is porting to Python and NEO4J*

### Docker
Run ./docker_start.sh to read some variables and build and launch neo4j and jupyter notebook containers. Console will print a token-based authentication link to paste into your browser to start a notebook, and there is an example notebook that shows how to connect to the database hosted by the neo4j docker instance. 

### Database 
Neo4j

### Graph traversal
Cypher 

### Language
Python3

### Version control
Git. As our team scales, leveraging proper best practices will become increasingly important. Please submit issues for new features and bugs, create branches when working on issues, and submit pull requests for merging back into master so everyone is synchronized. 

### Project management
We are using [Github Projects](https://github.com/jameswweis/scaling-science/projects) to coordinate the work and issues in the different branches of this project.
