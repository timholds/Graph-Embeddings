= Strongly Connected Components

_SCC_ is a class algorithms for finding groups of nodes where each node is directly reachable from every other node in the group. The strongly connected components  of an arbitrary directed graph form a partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly connected.There are several algorithms to compute the SCC.

== History, Explanation

Decomposing a directed graph into its strongly connected components is a classic application of depth-first search. The problem of finding connected components is at the heart of many graph application. Generally speaking, the connected components of the graph correspond to different classes of objects. The first linear-time algorithm for strongly connected components is due to Tarjan (1972).

A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between all pairs of vertices. This algorithms treats the graph as directed, so the direction of the relationship is important and strongly connected compoment exists only if there are relationships between nodes in both direction.

CREATE (nAlice:User {id:'Alice'})

.Running algorithm and writing back results

CALL algo.scc('User','FOLLOW', {write:true,clusterProperty:'cluster'})
YIELD loadMillis, computeMillis, writeMillis, setCount, maxSetSize, minSetSize

.Results

| name | cluster
| Alice | 1
| Bridget | 1
| Michael | 1
| Charles | 0
| Doug | 2
| Mark | 2

We can see that we have 2 strongly connected components in our sample graph. The first and biggest component has members Alice,Bridget,Michael and the second compomenet has Doug and Mark. 

.Find the largest cluster

RETURN distinct(u.cluster) as cluster,count(*) as size_of_cluster ORDER by size_of_cluster DESC LIMIT 1

.Running algorithm and writing back results
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.scc(label:String, relationship:String, {write:true,clusterProperty:'cluster'}) 
YIELD loadMillis, computeMillis, writeMillis, setCount, maxSetSize, minSetSize

- finds strongly connected clusters and potentially writes back to the node as a property cluster.

_SCC_ is a class algorithms for finding groups of nodes where each node is directly reachable from every other node in the group. There are several algorithms to compute the SCC. Our current implementation (still in graphtest project) implements _Tarjan's_ SCC algorithm.
