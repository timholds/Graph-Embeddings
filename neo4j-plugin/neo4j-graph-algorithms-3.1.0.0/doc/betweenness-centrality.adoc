= Betweenness Centrality

_Betweenness Centrality_ is a measure of centrality in a graph. In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality identify the most important vertices within a graph. It is based on observation, that every pair of vertices exchange information and information flows along the geodesic (shortest) path between two vertices. For every pair of vertices in a connected graph, there exists at least one shortest path between the vertices such that either the number of edges , that the path passes through ( unweighted network ) or the sum of the weights of the edges is minimized ( weighted network). The betweenness centrality for each node is the number of these shortest paths, that pass through the node.

== History, Explanation

_Betweenness Centrality_ finds wide application in network theory. It represents the degree of which nodes stand between each other. For example, in a telecommunications network, a node with higher betweenness centrality would have more control over the network, because more information will pass through that node. Betweenness centrality was devised as a general measure of centrality. It applies to a wide range of problems in network theory, including problems related to social networks, biology, transport and scientific cooperation.

Although earlier authors have intuitively described centrality as based on betweenness, Freeman (1977) gave the first formal definition of betweenness centrality. The idea was earlier proposed by mathematician J. Anthonisse, but his work was never published.






== When to use it / use-cases

image::{img}/betweenness_centrality.png[]


_Betweenness centrality_ is useful in finding vertices that serve as a bridge from one part of a graph to
another. Consequently, betweenness is a rudimentary measure of the control, that a specific node exerts
over the flow throughout the full graph. For example, Alice in above example is the
main connection in the graph. Were Alice to be removed, all connections in the graph would be cut off. This makes Alice “important”, because it ensures that no nodes are isolated. When using
betweenness centrality as an analysis measure, it indicates a potential gate keeping or controlling node. 

It differs from the other centrality measures. A node can have quite low degree, be connected to others that have low degree, even be a long way from others on average, and still have high betweenness. Consider a node A that lies on a bridge between two groups of vertices within a network. Since any path between nodes in different groups must go through this bridge, node A acquires high betweenness even though it is not well connected (it lies at the periphery of both groups).

== Algorithm explanation on simple sample graph


People with high betweenness tend to be the innovators and brokers in any network. They combine different perspectives, transfer ideas between groups (or decide to withold them), and get power from their ability to make introductions and pull strings.

In graph theory, betweenness centrality is a measure of centrality in a graph based on shortest paths. For every pair of vertices in a connected graph, there exists at least one shortest path between the vertices such that either the number of edges that the path passes through (for unweighted graphs) or the sum of the weights of the edges (for weighted graphs) is minimized. The betweenness centrality for each vertex is the number of these shortest paths that pass through the vertex.
