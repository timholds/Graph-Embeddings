= Page Rank

PageRank is Google's popular search algorithm. PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites

== History, Explanation

In order to measure the relative importance of web pages, Sergey Brin and Larry Page proposed PageRank, a method for
computing a ranking for every web page based on the graph of the web. PageRank has applications
in search, browsing, and traffic estimation.

PageRank is defined in the original Google paper as follows:

We assume page A has pages T1...Tn which point to it (i.e., are citations). The parameter d is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1. We usually set d to 0.85. Also C(A) is defined as the number of links going out of page A. The PageRank of a page A is given as follows:

PR(A) = (1-d) + d (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))

Note that the PageRanks form a probability distribution over web pages, so the sum of all web pages' PageRanks will be one.

PageRank or PR(A) can be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm, and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web.

|===
| name | pageRank 
| Home | 3.232

|===

As we expected, we see that Home page has the highest pageRank, because it has incoming links from all other pages. We can also observe, that not only the number of incoming links is important, but also the importance of the page, that links to us.

## Progress

- [x] single threaded implementation
- [x] tests
- [x] simple benchmark
- [ ] implement procedure
- [x] benchmark on bigger graphs
- [ ] parallelization
- [ ] evaluation

## Requirements

- NodeIterator
- Incoming Relationships
- Outgoing Degrees

## Data structured involved

Our current approach needs one double array for storing ranks.

## ToDo

### parallelization

One approach to parallelize _PageRank_ might be to partition the node into batches - one for each thread. Nonetheless we may need to sync them at the end of each iteration.

### evaluation

- Performance tests on different dataset sizes / level of concurrency

## Future Improvements

- we might scale up the ranks to ints for faster multiplication.
